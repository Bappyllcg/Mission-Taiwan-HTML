                    <p class="first-para">some thoughts on my 50th Birthday. I would not presume that I have earned the right to speak or
                        be heard. I would simply ask you to consider reading as a friend and fellow traveler along the
                        journey. These are my reflections on life on passing 50 years. For some a milestone, for others,
                        just a marker. Jesus, He is more Sovereign than I ever imagined. All that He has directed or
                        allowed in my life has been of ultimate good. I find something new about Him every day and He
                        becomes more satisfying the more my desire grows for Him.
                        <br><br>
                        24 years ago, nearly half of my life now, I couldn’t imagine that someone could become close
                        enough to truly know me, but in my wife, I have found a friend who does. She is beautiful,
                        generous and kind – a gift that has enriched my life and increased in value with age. Children,
                        the treasures that God gives us which become so much more. Only in a family could there be the
                        possibility that so much energy is contained by so much love that it must be like a nuclear
                        power plant. At times, the process seems like atoms smashing each other apart and it feels as if
                        the very fabric of space and time might rip open, and at other times, the energy produced seems
                        as if it could power a whole city, giving light, heat and life to everyone who is connected to
                        it’s source.</p>
                    <h2 class="blog-para-heading">The Importance of Friends</h2>
                    <p>Friends – for me, every new friend has opened a new world, a place not possibly known or entered
                        until they arrived. It seems my whole life has been spent on the move with some longer stops on
                        the way – and my journey is not yet complete, but in every place, there have been these amazing
                        and wonderful people that I have been blessed to call my friends. It has been my privilege to be
                        invited into their lives and share even the briefest moments, telling stories, sharing sorrows,
                        laughing uncontrollably, going on new adventures and best of all – experiencing a deeper
                        knowledge and love of Christ along the way. Thank you to each and every one of you – we will be
                        reunited on that great day together and see in full the story that God was writing through our
                        lives. </p>

                    <p>Moving abroad has been costly. but I can say that financially it has been the smallest cost –
                        losing a house and the “American lifestyle” – I’m so thankful that God allowed us this
                        particular gift of loss. The greater loss has been time with family, our children spending
                        holidays with their grandparents and relatives, my friends whom I deeply and daily miss their
                        presence, seeing my wife’s loneliness, wondering how each of my children will be affected, this
                        truly feels like loss but I know it is not. Eternally and temporally – this kind of loss is
                        counted differently in God’s ledger and will actually turn out to be gain. We have been obedient
                        to Christ’s command and the Bible says to obey is better than sacrifice.
                        <br><br>
                        Social Media has both harmed and helped me. It makes me crave attention I don’t need or deserve.
                        And at the same time allows me to know about people who I would have long forgotten about. It
                        drains my attention and fills my time that could and should be spent in the present with people
                        that God has providentially placed in my path, and it gives me an artificial sense of importance
                        and power when people like something I say. It is not going away and will continue to evolve.
                        <br><br>
                        Parenting is much harder than I thought it would be. Any success has nothing to do with me, but
                        is a gift of God’s grace and is largely in spite of my mistakes. My best and most Biblical
                        advice would be to make sure your children respect you when they are small or they will most
                        likely hate you when they grow up. Many parents today tie their identity to their children which
                        becomes fatally dangerous to both the child and the parents. </p>

                    <p>Think, then say and or do what you mean, without being mean. For much of my life, I was afraid of
                        everyone and what the consequences of my words and actions would be. But by a work of God’s
                        grace, that changed and I have mostly overcome the fear of man with a healthy fear of God. That
                        has set me free to be myself and also to help others in the process. This does not and should
                        not mean a selfish pursuit of my own ends, but rather a humble understanding of who I am and how
                        I relate to others.
                        <br><br>
                        To my friends in the West – a few words of encouragement. It took me a long time to learn what I
                        was given this life for. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Please don’t</b> make the mistake of living only for material things. </li>
                        <li><b>The world will easily</b> convince you that pleasure and satisfaction can be found in
                            wealth, experiences and even family. </li>
                        <li><b>The Bible gives</b> us a different and higher purpose, while enjoying </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To my eastern friends, I would offer a similar message. You have been taught that family is more
                        important than anything. But, the Bible tells us that our love for God must supersede everything
                        else in life, bringing order and meaning to those things. Our greatest pursuit is not education,
                        a job with status, being able to travel and escape the cares of this life, but embracing this
                        life and the next with passion and purpose, bringing glory and honor to our true Father and in
                        the process also honoring our earthly family. </p>
